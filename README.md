## Interactive Objects & Systems

In this course, students will learn how to create interactive objects and systems by building them with physical computing. Physical computing is a means to create interactive systems that translate human expressions from the surrounding world to the digital world, using both software and hardware. Physical Computing is one approach to human-computer interaction design. Taking the human body as a given, students will learn how a computer converts the changes in energy given off by our bodies – sound, light, heat, motion, etc. – into changing electronic signals that computers can read and interpret. Students will learn to build and program their own micro-controller board, with an emphasis on techniques and approaches for the generation of temporal and spatial processes. Through discussions of design interfaces and interactivity, students will design computing applications that utilize these forms of physical expression. Possibilities include the control of kinetic sculptures, custom performance interfaces, installations, the presence of sound or light and reactive/interactive/responsive works.

Students will be building circuits, writing code, soldering, creating systems that track and control input and output which generates some form of expression.

### Course Pre-requisites

This course utilizes programming, electronics and coupling them together to create interactive systems.

It is helpful to have some basic knowledge of programming (Java, C++, Processing, JavaScript, C#, etc). If you do not have that, I suggest studying the handouts in the reference section, which cover introductory concepts for programming. If you are unsure, review the documents to refresh your memory, if nothing else. Programming will be utilized within and throughout the course. Programming Topics will be covered in lecture. 

This is an introductory course in circuits and electronics. No prior experience is necessary.


### Program Objectives 

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.

* develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.

* develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

* develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.


### Course Objectives

•	To gain an articulate an awareness and sensitivity of interactive systems, including the difference between reactive, interactive and responsive systems as well as input and output

•	To design engaging interactive systems, which encourage interaction and exploration

•	To design systems which liberate the computer from traditional definitions and to exist within the physical world around us.

•	Competent circuit construction

•	Further development/utilization of programming skills

•	Completion of several exercises and a final project for group critiques


## Course Structure

This is a hybrid course - both online and in the physical classroom. Video lectures and readings must to be completed BEFORE class time. Class time will be an active lab with challenges, workshops, class discussions, critiques and making. 

The structure of the semester will be the following:

Part I: Basic circuits, basic programming, input and output

Part II: Devices, Networking and reliable interaction

Part III: Final Project

### Grades

Assignment briefs list the minimum requirements for the assignment completion. Basic completion of assignments is just that...basic. Basic/average work is a C grade. If you expect higher than a C grade, I expect more out of your assignments. I look to you to expand, to explore, to research and to dive into the assignments and to use them to activate your ideas. Feedback is given to help you explore what this means for you and your projects. Ideas are also suggested, in order to feed your projects. Feeding ideas and feeding projects strengthens them and moves them beyond average.

•	Exercises & Challenges: 45% 

•	Final Prototype (Alpha) – 10%

•	Final Project – 25%

•	Process Site – 10%

•	Engagement & Participation – 10%

Grades will be attributed to work based on your understanding and comprehension of the course materials & principles (both from the texts and lectures), creativity and craft. (Craft refers to the care you've taken to create the work. Is it thought out, considered, and sound? Or is it thrown together and hapazard?) All of these will be evident in your projects and participation throughout class


##### A. Excellent (90-100: Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the theory and practice behind physical computing.

##### B. Very Good / Good (80-89: Work of high quality)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of physical computing.

##### C. Satisfactory (70-79: Average; Satisfies course requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of physical computing.

##### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69: Deficient, but passing)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of physical computing. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

##### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below: Failing Course Requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. 

### Late Work
Unless specified, work is due the BEFORE following class period.

Work that is turned in after class but still on the due date get's 1/3 letter grade deduction. Work that is turned in the same week, get's 2/3 grade deduction. Subsequent submissions get one letter grade deduction for ever week that it is late, beyond the first week. The lowest possible grade a late assignment will be given, will be an "F". Deductions are calculated AFTER the initial grade is given.

If work is turned in beyond 4 weeks, the work must still meet the requirements for the assignment, or be an attempt in that direction. Work submitted beyond 4 weeks that does not make an attempt to meet the requirements will not be considered and a zero will be given for that assignment.

Assignments that are not submitted will receive a "0". Please realize that a "0" mark is a fantastic way to tank your grade. Getting an F (63%) is far better than getting a zero (0%). Do the math.

### Assessment
Assessment will occur by reviewing weekly assignments & challenges, project milestones, and final projects. The course is cumulative.  Please see the Grading Section for specific grade breakdown, calendar for due dates, and assignments for briefs. Grades will be individually distributed via Slack Direct Message. Feedback occurs during class critique as well as on Slack. Do review those comments as feedback for future projects and tips.

The assignments are your opportunity to put your skills to the test. They're designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me valuable information about how you're progressing in the class. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k"> Finished is better than perfect. </a> An attempt at them is better than nothing at all. 

Students will evaluate their own progressed in a course in three ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7  & Week 15   or as otherwise noted. This written evaluation is an important componet to assessing your Engagement and Participation Grade. It will be turned into me as a separate document. 3.) Turning in Tickets to Leave when requested, which will be almost weekly.

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning programming concepts & electronics concepts vs. actually programming, building and making. How does this reflect on the final quality of your end result? 

### Student Responsibilities

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s)
* Devote at a minimum 8 to 10 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Demonstrate Curiosity
* Take risks, push yourself and be fearless in your projects
* Consult slack at least twice a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Give your classmates constructive feedback. Don't be passive in critiques or take it personally. Push everyone's ideas further.
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Direct message me on slack re: contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not direct message me long conversations on slack. (if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work

### Contacting Me
[Slack](https://ios-sp18.slack.com/) Direct Message is the preferred initial contact. Otherwise you may email me (katherine.bennett@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Class is a community. There is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential. Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. 

Course material missed is your own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s.

• One unexcused absence is allowed; After that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 points out of 100 for each additional unexcused absences.

• 3 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Critiques can not be made up.

• Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not.

• Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. ([Slack](https://ios-sp18.slack.com/) Direct message is preferred). Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Be on time! Lateness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes you are late, your participation grade drops.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus. Consult Github for the demo code. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. Review the texts and resources. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. Do these things first. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

• If you have some extenuating need to be outside of class (special doctor's appointment, religious observations, etc etc), please contact Judith Simonsen at (Js6244@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046). She is the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance. 


### Important Aspects to this Course

• **Time** Time management is everything. You will need it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings and videos are essential. Writing code and constructing circuits are the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly, if you are not doing this and you will fall behind. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-10 hours outside of class to succeed. 

My personal favorite time management tools are [KanBan](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), [Ink and Volt Planner](https://inkandvolt.com/product/volt-planner/) (also available in undated), the [Pomodoro technique](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)

• **Using code found elsewhere:** It's super easy to find code online. As tempting as this is, I am going to ask that you write your own code for the first 2/3 of the semester. This will help you grasp and retain the fundamentals. It does help to write the code from the book out, line by line. Yet, make a reference to it. Code that is not written by you, nor properly referenced and expanded upon, can not be submitted as a homework assignment, project or pair programming challenge as your own work. Period.

If you use code from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to site the work and author, *as well as* to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. Do *not* summarize several lines of code from a high level (ie, TV Guide or horoscope-style). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It's bending these concepts to your idea. It's not a copy and paste job.

Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period.

If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assigment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

### How to Submit Assignments via GitHub

To do this, you will be utilizing 3 apps: a browser, github desktop and a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, Terminal, etc) to complete this entire process.


Do the follow these steps to setup each assignment on Github:

	* 0. Save your work AND all of the necessary support files (index.html, libraries folder, pictures, media, etc) in a folder that is titled in this manner on your computer:
					*YourFirstNameYourLastName_AssignmentNumber*, etc.
	* 1. Go to your Github Repository page in a browser and create a new repo for the assignment, naming it Creative_Coding_Sketch_1

	* 2. Clone that repo to your desktop (it should launch the Github desktop app). Save that folder within a folder on your computer for this class.

	* 3. Using a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, etc), take the folder created in step 0 and drop it INSIDE the folder you just created by cloning in step 2.

	* 4. Go back to the GitHub Desktop app. In the summary field, write what additions you have made to your code in summary. In the description, add greater details, notes, and questions for me.

	* 5. Hit the "sync button" in the upper right hand corner. This uploads your code to your repo page on the Github website.

	* 6. Refresh your browser page of your repo. You should now see your code and files up on your repo

	* 7. As you continue to work on this project, save the code on your desktop, in the folder created in step 0, and have sinced moved to be within the folder created at step 2. After saving each work session's progress, re-visit the Github desktop app to push the changes to your Github repo online. Make sure to fill out the summary and description notes. Do NOT and I repeat, DO NOT, make a new folder within this folder with the weeks editions. IE, you should not have "Week 1 work", "week 2 work", etc. Github tracks your changes and keeps them in history. It's version control! Yay!

### Process Site & GitHub

Creating anything involves a series of steps. Often, we think of these steps as a straight line. Many times we (think we) can go on auto-pilot after the first few step and coast to the finish. This is not the case when working with these mediums. You will constantly be confronted with challenges. In the process of resolving those challenges you'll be faced with opportunites to grow, expand and discover along side paths. These side paths are what enrich your projects to be engaging and meanful.

Work in this class moves beyond the simple, "get it working" to "how can we tweak this and make it better". You must move through and work out technical challenges to get to this point.

Reviewing our process through documentation, allows us to reflect and to gather thoughts as to what our next step should be in our process. Research gives us new insight. Drawing and sketching helps articulate our thoughts. We can translate these ideas to interactive systems using code and various forms of media.

You must have of evidence and collection of your ideas, research, and process (including steps and action). This is imperative. You must be organized and be able to show the development of your ideas and concepts. Also, you’ll need to be taking notes and images during workshops and demos. 

Your [Process Site](Process_Site.md) is where all of this information goes, along with reflections, context and dialogue. If you're Process site is thin, your work is thin and needs more energy into your process.

Your Process site must have good, clear, good resolution documentation. Images and links of what inspires you. Links to media. Sketches, Drawings. System diagrams. Code, prototypes, installations, interfaces, user experience. Everything should be making an appearance on your Process Site.

Github is where your code lives. A link to your Github must appear on your [Process Site](Process_Site.md).

### Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Tandon is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students.  The mission of the Office for Students with Disabilities is to provide individuals with learning differences (a.ka. disabilities) the same access to programs and activities as other students.  We assist students to maximize their potential while helping them develop and maintain independence.

Students who believe they are eligible for course accommodations under the ADA or Section 504 or have had accommodations please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.  You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations.  Information about the Moses Center can be found at http://www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor. 

Faculty can provide course accommodations/modifications only after receipt of an approved accommodations letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Accommodation letters can be provided to qualified students at any time during the semester, but grades earned before the faculty receives the letter cannot be changed.


### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. The experience is better for everyone in the class, if everyone can be present and active. It not only helps you, but it helps your neighbor. Again, we live in a community and we must think beyond our own needs.

[Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw)

When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.

Be forewarned, that if you are chronically in your devices and not participating in conversation, you will be called upon. Class is a community.


### Academic Integrity

The School of Engineering encourages academic excellence in an environment that promotes honesty, integrity, and fairness, and students at the School of Engineering are expected to exhibit those qualities in their academic work. It is through the process of submitting their own work and receiving honest feedback on that work that students may progress academically. Any act of academic dishonesty is seen as an attack upon the School and will not be tolerated. Furthermore, those who breach the School’s rules on academic integrity will be sanctioned under this Policy. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the School’s Policy on Academic Misconduct.

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference. See "Important Aspects to This Course" (above) and bullet point number 4 for greater elaboration on definition, requirements and expectations for utilizing code found elsewhere.
