## DIY Custom Switch

Sketch and Design 5 different custom switches using found materials, such as paper, cardboard, balloons, paper towel tubes, fabric, wood, string, etc. Then choose 2 (minimum) of them and transfer them into functioning DIY switches. Use a LED, appropriate resistors, 9 Volt battery and battery snap with your switch.

One circuit must be a parallel circuit. The other a series circuit. It's up to you how many LED's and resistors that you want to use. (Remember and utilize Ohm's Law, in order to calculate the proper resistors.)

Think of the gesture used to engage the switch. I'm looking for you to go beyond the typical and obvious press switch. The more creative, the better. Think of all the things our hands can do. Think of the ways a hand can manipulate and engage with an object. How can your hand or body manipulate the object to engage/trigger the switch? 
 
### Requirements: 

*	Sketch and Design 5 different switches. Use the storyboard templates to not only show the design in each state, but the interaction. 

*	Document the construction process with images for each switch. Multiple images for each switch.

* 	Create a circuit schematic for your final 2 switches.

*	Create a short documentation video showing each switch showing each state and the interaction. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, clear and crisp. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 1 minute.

*	Submit your sketches, images and video to your Process Site along with a brief explanation. 

* 	Bring the switches to class next week
